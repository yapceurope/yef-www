<p>The duties of the YEF Venue Committee are:
<ul>
<li>Writing the 'Call for Venue' for the next YAPC Europe conference
<li>Setting a deadline for proposals
<li>Receiving proposals, discussing and comparing them (if any present
  board member has submitted a proposal, that board member will not
  participate in this stage of the process)
<li>The committee presents the board with a recommendation which the board
votes on (historically the board has always abided by the committee's
recommendation)
</ul>

<p>You can reach the Venue Committee by sending an email to <a
href="mailto:venue@yapceurope.org">venue@yapceurope.org</a>.
More information on preparing a YAPC::Europe bid or organizing an
event can be found in the <a href="[% ye_org_page %]">YAPC::Europe
bid</a> section.

<a name="schedule">
<h2>Annual schedule</h2>
</a>

<p>This is an approximate schedule of what the Venue Committee does during the
year. The schedule depends on the exact date of the current and the next
YAPC::Europe. Traditionally, YAPC::Europe takes place between the middle
and the end of August.
If the event is held earlier, the call for venues will generally have the
same deadline, but less time will be available for deliberations and
responses.  
</p>

<p>
March<br />
<ul>
<li>The 'Call for Venue' for next year's YAPC is published.  E.g.
in March 2009 the call is for YAPC::Europe 2010.</li>
</ul>

April<br />
<ul>
<li>Groups which are considering submitting a proposal to host YAPC::Europe
should send the Venue Committee a "letter of intent."  This letter
simply expresses interest in hosting the conference and provides
contact information (email plus phone numbers) for at least two
organizers.  This is an optional step but it can be to your advantage
to alert the venue committee of your proposal.
</li>
</ul>

June<br />
<ul>
<li>End of June - Call for Venue deadline. A full proposal should be
submitted to the Venue Committee.  <b>Note that the Venue Committee will
be making this proposal public</b>, so you
may submit supplemental information (such as a budget) which will not
be posted on the YAPC::Europe website.</li>
<li>Member of the Venue Committee will send an acknowledgment to all
  parties on receipt of their proposals (this could be in July if
the deadline is June 30th).</li>
</ul>

July<br />
<ul>
<li> Week 1 - Venue Committee reviews proposals and prepares any additional
  questions they may have.</li>
<li> Week 2 - Additional questions sent to proposal parties.  There is
a one week deadline for responding to the Venue Committee.</li>
<li> Week 3 - Venue Committee reviews questions and discusses all 
proposals.</li>
<li> Week 4 - Voting. Each member of the Venue Committee submits her or his
  vote.</li>
<li> Week 5 - Venue Chair presents the Venue Committee's recommendation to
  the board, who will then approve or question the recommendation within
  a couple of days.</li>
<li> End of July - Decision made for the host for the following year's
  YAPC::Europe.</li>  
</ul>

August<br />
<ul>
<li> At the beginning of August, all parties are notified of whether they
  have won or lost their bid.</li>
<li> Winners are asked to prepare a short presentation about their host
  city and any plans they may wish to unveil (e.g. venue, dates, price
  of beer etc.)</li>
<li> Winners also asked to find a suitable gift of the host city or nation
  for the current YAPC organizers. </li>
<li> More precise details of the above 2 points are included in the winning
  notification mail.</li>
<li>During current YAPC::Europe, the location of the next year's
  YAPC::Europe is announced, i.e. at YAPC::Europe 2009 the location for
  2010 will be announced.   The organizers need to leave at least 10
  minutes in the schedule for this (for the announcement, and for showing
  the presentation).  The announcement is usually done by someone
  from the Venue Committee or the YEF board.</li>
</ul>
